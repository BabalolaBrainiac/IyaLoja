IyaLoja is a digital version of the conventional "African Market"
A platform where you can buy Tokenized food items, which can be converted to actual food items delivered to you, or transfer food token to another, sell for Fiat, or just hold and store and use when you need it-digital freezer, i suppose. 

PS:
I am not a Blockchain dev,and so i am hardcoding tokens using Mongoose Schemas. 
Collaborations from Blockchain devs are very much welcome
