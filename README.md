IyaLoja is a digital version of the conventional "African Market".

A platform where you can buy Tokenized food items, which can be converted to actual food items delivered to you, or transfer tokens to another, sell for Fiat, or just hold and store for use or sale whenever you want. A form of a digital refrigerator, i suppose. 

PS:
I am not a Blockchain dev,and so i am hardcoding tokens using Mongoose Schemas, and some other libraries
Collaborations from Blockchain devs are very much welcome
